# PI_RGB #

This is an application that allows you to control a LED strip connected to a Raspberry Pi, 
through a web tool. Which allows any device connected to the network the capability to control 
the LED strip. It uses a React Js UI and a Python Web Socket to send the necessary data to the 
[WS281X Library](https://github.com/jgarff/rpi_ws281x), allowing the LEDs to change color.
